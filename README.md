# NYC-CitiBike- Data-Analysis

## Project Summary

This project explores New York City's Citi Bike system to uncover insights into urban mobility trends. Using cleaned trip data, I performed an exploratory analysis to identify patterns in ride frequency, user demographics, and behavior across days, times, and user types. The goal was to support data-driven decision-making for improving service delivery, customer engagement, and operational efficiency.

Through Python and Tableau, I analyzed key metrics such as ride duration, peak usage hours, gender and age distribution, and differences between casual customers and loyal subscribers. A final Tableau storyboard presents the most impactful findings and strategic recommendations, including ways to target underrepresented users and optimize bike availability during high-demand periods.

This project demonstrates skills in data cleaning, visualization, storytelling, and business analysis—essential for solving real-world challenges with data.

## Key Questions

1.When are Citi Bike rides most frequent during the day and week?

2.How does ridership differ between subscribers and casual customers?

3.What are the typical trip durations by user type?

4.What is the gender and age distribution of riders?

5.Are there noticeable trends in commuting behavior?

6.How can Citi Bike improve service for underrepresented or low-usage groups?

7.What business opportunities exist to increase engagement and optimize operations?
